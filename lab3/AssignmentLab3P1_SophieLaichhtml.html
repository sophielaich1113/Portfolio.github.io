<h3>Cartography II<br /> Geog 5610<br /> Sophie Laich</h3>
	<h1>Writing your project proposal </h1>
	<p>This quick map proposal is due on Oct 7th.
	The document has to be brief and the project plan schedule to start on Oct 10th and to end on Dec 14th. 
	Thus, it is a small project in which you need to design and implement an interactive map using ESRI API (Module 4).
	This proposal must include five parts: a paragraph describing the purpose of your interactive map, a paragraph with the structure of the map,
	a paragraph with a table describing your data sources, a paragraph describing your methodology, and a timeframe for data collection, methodology,
	design, and evaluation. For a better understanding of these components of the proposal, they are described in more detail below. </p>
	<ol>
		<li><i class="heading">Describing the purpose of the map.</I> The first paragraph of the proposal should address these questions:
		What is the general geographical problem or concept that you are exploring with this map project? For whom is this map intended? 
		What do you hope to learn from creating this interactive map?
		What kind of interactivity do you hope to include for data exploration?</li>
		<li><i class="heading">The structure of the map.</i> The next paragraph is resulting from solving these questions: 
		Which thematic or geographic features will you include in the map? What kind of thematic techniques will you use (
		choropleth, proportional symbols, graduated symbols, isarithmic, etc.)? 
		How will you provide supplementary data to the viewer (tables, graphs, ancillary text)? 
		What kind of data or information will those ancillary elements contain?</li>
		<li><i class="heading">Data sources.</i> The third paragraph explains: where will the data and information of your map come from? What are their metadata 
		(scale, year published or created, and agency or person distributing it)? </li>
		<li><i class="heading">Methodology.</i> In this part you need to explain the preprocessing of your data (sequence or process to have your data ready to incorporate it in your map)
		such as the process you follow in task one of lab 2.
		Describe in here the different activities you need to complete in ArcGIS Online or other software. </li>
		<li><i class="heading">Timeframe.</i> In this part of the proposal you must display in a table the duration, starting and ending dates of the different stages of the map like data collection, data processing, interactivity design 
		(conceptual stage, production, and implementation levels), and production, and evaluation. </li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Specs:</h2>
